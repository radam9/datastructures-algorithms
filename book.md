## Data Structures

- Arrays
  - Static: arrays with fixed size during runtime.
  - Dynamic: arrays with modifiable size during runtime.
- Sets: arrays that only allow unique values.
- Stack: arrays that only allow insertions, deletions and reads from the end of the array.
- Queue: arrays that only allow insertions, deletions and reads from the start of the array.
- Hash Tables: 

## Concepts

- Time Complexity (Big O)
- Recursion
- Dynamic Programming: ways to optimize recursion.
  - optimal substructure.
  - overlapping sub-problems.
  - Method 1: take any common recursive calls and call them once, then assign them to a variable. This eliminates the need to run the recursive call several times.
  - Method 2: Top-Down (Memoization), store overlapping subproblems in a hash table, and use them instead of calling the recursive function again.
  - Method 3: Bottom-Up (Tabulation), convert the recursive function into an iteration instead.
